ðŸ“œ Description
The ProductLaunch smart contract is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move language.
It enables creators to raise funds for their product ideas and launch them once the funding goal is reached before a specified deadline.
Supporters (backers) can contribute Aptos tokens, and funds are released only if the project meets its goal.

ðŸŽ¯ Vision
To empower creators and innovators by providing a trustless, transparent, and decentralized platform for crowdfunding product launches â€” removing the need for intermediaries and ensuring backersâ€™ contributions are secure until launch conditions are met.

ðŸ”® Future Scope
Multi-token support for different cryptocurrencies beyond AptosCoin.
Partial funding models allowing creators to receive funds even if the goal is not fully met.
Automated milestone releases for gradual fund distribution.
NFT-based rewards for backers to incentivize participation.
Governance features enabling backers to vote on project changes.
